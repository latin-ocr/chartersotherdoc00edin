PREFACE. xxvii

to the cares of the magistrates, and made the preservation of the
peace a matter of well-founded solicitude. The varied interests
thus represented, and many of the great social7 political, and
religious changes through which Scot-land passed during the three
hundred years preceding the Union, are reflected in the civic
administratum, the records of which, accordingly, possess a na-
tional importance. Sometimes even those portions which seem
least interesting are not the least valuable to the local historian‚
as throwing light upon customs and institutions the origin of
which is now obscure. It is much to be desired that some com-
petent person would write a history of Edinburgh, embodying
the results of a careful investigation of original materials of
which neither Maitland nor Arnot has availed himself. For the
preparation of such a work, the present volume, with the first
volume of Extracts from the Council Records already published‚
and the second volume which is passing through the press, may
afford some facilities. In the meantime, it is hoped the following
pages may be useful to those who take an interest in the early
history of the City and its institutions, aud are charged with the
management of its affairs.

The Table of Contents contains an Abstract of the various
Charters and other Documents printed in this volume, with a
reference to the source from which each has been taken.
