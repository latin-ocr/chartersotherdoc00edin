dicatur Altissimus ac in hospitalibus et aliis piis Iocis pauperum et
aliarum miserabilium personarum necessitatibus succuratur nec non
hiis que propterea processisse comperimus ut perpetuo illibata persistant
Apostolici muniminis adjicimus firmitatem Sane pro parte dilecte in
Christo filie nostre Marie Regine Scotorum illustris nobis nuper exhibita
petitio continebat quod olim ipsa de propria salute recogitans et ad
caritatis opera maxime circa egenos et pauperes manus juxta evangelica
documenta extendens dum adhuc clare memorie Jacobus Π. Rex
Scotorum vir ejus ageret in humanis quoddam Hospitale pro susceptione
pauperum et egenorum eorundem extra oppidum regium de Edinburgh
Sancti Andree diocesis construi et edificari fecit illudque dotavit et
successive boni operis fructum provida consideratione attendens et ad
majora pietatis officia ferventius aspirans juxta Hospitale predictum
quandam insignem ecclesiam sive capellam pro Collegio fundato unius
